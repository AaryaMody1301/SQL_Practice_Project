# SQL Practice Project  
A collection of SQL queries and exercises to demonstrate data analysis and database management skills.  

## Overview  
This repository showcases my proficiency in SQL through practical examples, including data querying, aggregation, and optimization. The project reflects my ability to extract actionable insights from datasets, a skill I've applied in real-world scenarios like sentiment analysis and sales forecasting.  

## Features  
- **Data Querying**: Complex SELECT statements with joins, subqueries, and filters.  
- **Aggregation**: Calculated metrics (e.g., averages, counts) for analysis.  
- **Optimization**: Efficient query design for performance.  

## Project Structure
- **Project_sql/**: Main SQL queries focusing on job market and skills analysis
- **sql_files/**: Practice SQL queries demonstrating various SQL concepts
- **sql_load/**: Database setup scripts (create database, tables, and modifications)
- **csv_files/**: Source data files (not included in repository)

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository
